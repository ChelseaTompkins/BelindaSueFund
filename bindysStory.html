    <p>Belinda Sue Nantais, or Bindy as she was known to us all, fought valiantly for just over four years against Ovarian Cancer.  She was diagnosed in July 2007 in Stage IIIc of the disease which eventually metastasized to her lung.  After a long hard battle, she died on August 22, 2011 at age 52.
    </p>

    <p>Bindy was born on September 16, 1958 in Detroit, Michigan. She began high school at Warren High and graduated from Berkley High School in Berkley, MI in 1976.  She went on to receive a Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education and a minor in Psychology from Oakland University.  Due to her precious love for children, she pursued a career in pre-kinder and elementary education, which included in the latter part of her career, opening her own pre-school with one of her dearest friends, Cindy Purkey.
    </p>

    <p>Bindy enjoyed lake activities including waterskiing, pontoon boat rides, and just being in the sun. She also loved taking cruises with her husband and children and enjoyed summers up North at the family's cottage. Spending time with family and friends was most important to Bindy, whether it be simply watching movies or having an impromptu get-together at the house. She cherished "girl time" with her daughter, Caroline, and loved listening to her son, Matthew, play his guitar. Hearing her husband, Tom, play the piano especially around the Christmas holiday was also very special to Bindy. Above all, she lived her life to the fullest and had a deep, abiding faith. One of the quotes which would best describe how Bindy lived is this:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away."</p>

    <p>While we will miss hearing Bindy's heartfelt laugh and seeing her beautiful smile, her spirit will be ever present in our hearts.  And it is because of her powerful spirit and her love for life, that this charity was created.  Her greatest desire was that at least one life be saved through promoting awareness of this dreaded disease, which is the deadliest of the gynecologic cancers, and developing better screening tools in order to detect Ovarian Cancer in its early stages.  It is her family and friends' desire to fulfill Bindy's wishes and save as many lives as possible.
